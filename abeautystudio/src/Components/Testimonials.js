Didn't catch the lady's name but she was excellent. She checked in with me after one brow was done to ensure I liked it. Very good price as well, only $8! Will be coming back for sure !! :)</blockquote>

I tried this place in desperation because I needed a place close to my house. I'm so glad I did. This is now my go-to threading spot. I see Rita every time. Highly recommend.</blockquote>
